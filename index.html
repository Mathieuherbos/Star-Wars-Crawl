             <p>Like last week, I've started to learn @Be Code.<br/>
                We have already learned a bunch of stuff such as wath's the teminal and how to use it,
                We learned what GitHub is and how to work with it, we did severall different exercices 
                such as the exquisite corpse in group of four.<br/>
                Then we started learning about HTML and CSS, I've followed some theory on openclassroom about it,
                and again we add some exercices to do to get familiar with it.<br/>
                We first had to write some markdown and translate it into a HTML page, then we learned how to publish a page 
                with GitHub. We did a 404 error page a CV and a Vcard also.<br/>
                Just after the Vcard and the notion of grid experienced I'm on this exercice that took me a bit longer
                because it's a bit more tricky to use and understand animation but I think I'll understand it better with 
                time and practice so as html for example.<br/>
